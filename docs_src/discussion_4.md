# Discussion 4 – Launch & Showcase

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

## Session Goals
- Finalize dashboards, rehearse the narrative, and ship a polished deliverable.
- Optionally deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud (or package a reproducible local run) and document handoff steps.
- Present dashboards to peers, emphasizing insights, design choices, and future enhancements.
- Reflect on lessons learned about working with WRDS/CRSP data and the FTSFR benchmarking codebase.

## Warm-Up (12:00 – 12:20 pm)
- Status stand-up: deployment status, remaining blockers, requests for instructor help.
- Quick reminder of presentation rubric (insights, evidence, clarity, polish, next steps).

## Segment A · Final Build Sprint (12:20 – 1:20 pm)
- Triage tasks: data refresh, polish copy, tidy charts, verify metrics.
- Instructor mini-clinics on Streamlit Cloud secrets, environment files, and troubleshooting common errors.
- Optional: record a 30-second walkthrough to use as backup in case Wi-Fi fails during live demos.

## Segment B · Dress Rehearsal (1:20 – 1:50 pm)
- Teams pair up and perform dry runs, exchanging targeted feedback using the rubric.
- Checklist: intro hook, key insights, demonstration flow, forecasting explanation, call to action.

## Segment C · Showcase (2:30 – 3:30 pm)
- Each team presents for ~6 minutes with 3 minutes of Q&A.
- Encourage observers to ask about data choices, model selection, and deployment hurdles.
- Capture highlights and common themes for a wrap-up discussion.

## Segment D · Retrospective & Next Steps (3:30 – 4:00 pm)
- Group reflection: what surprised you about forecasting and visualization? What will you try next with WRDS data?
- Share curated list of resources: Streamlit docs, Plotly styling guides, FTSFR issue tracker for contributions, deployment tutorials.
- Close with optional stretch goals (e.g., multi-page Streamlit apps, hooking in live WRDS queries, experimenting with alternative models).

## Deliverables & Documentation
- Final dashboard repository or ZIP with clear README instructions (`streamlit run src/...`).
- Deployment link (if using Streamlit Community Cloud) or clear instructions for local run.
- Short reflection posted to Canvas: what you would expand if you had another week, and how the FTSFR benchmark informs your next steps.
